# World Gov Challenge 

Repository for code and analysis for my World Government Data Vis Challenge entry, found here: http://vallandingham.me/world_gov_challenge/

This repo is broken into 2 parts. 

* The `analysis/` directory contains an R notebook with some data exploration and raw datasets for analysis
* The rest is the visualization implemented with D3 and React. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Running Analysis

You should be able to open the `analysis.Rmd` in RStudio and re-run all the analysis there.

## Running Interactive

In the root directory, install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Then Start the project locally with:

```
npm start
```

And as always, have fun!
